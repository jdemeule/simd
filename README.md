# simd

A toy implementation of `std::simd`.
It is not complet, and probably full of bugs.

The code was written in C++17 and quickly adapted to C++23.
Mostly follow the norm for the implemented part but may faced some difference to ease the implementation.
Miss lot of parts, and some variants in the implemented ones.

Clearly here to help myself to understand how to write SIMD algorithms.
